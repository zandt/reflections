Reflections lesson 1
====================

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
By only displaying lines that differ between the two versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Gives me the ability to efficiently go through changes, to find bugs that was introduced at som point.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
	vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
+ logical commits
+ number of versions at a suitable level
- relies on the user not to forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
	while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Files are dependent on each other should all be saved together at each commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists history with comments
git diff commit_id1 commit_id2 lists the differences between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You  can always go back to find the prvious working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Surely a good thing to be able to set up your own workspace, BUT:
I tried everything, still gitbash doesn't recognize .bash_profile.
